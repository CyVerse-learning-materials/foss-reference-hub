# Data Management Plan

This document takes into consideration data that *would* be collected and made available for dplPy and dendrochronologist to use.

## 1. Data Description
We will collect tree ring measurements from various tree species in our study area. Data will include tree ring width measurements, corresponding years, and species information. These measurements will be stored in structured CSV and RWL files, with metadata indicating sample location, collection date, and field methods.

## 2. Data Collection
Tree cores will be extracted from trees using increment borers. Ring width measurements will be taken using specialized equipment. Species identification will be done based on field observations and confirmed through lab analysis.

## 3. Data Storage and Backup
Tree ring data and associated metadata will be stored in a dedicated directory on our secure research server. Automated daily backups will be conducted to ensure data integrity.

## 4. Data Organization and Documentation
Data will be organized by sample location, species, and collection year. Each dataset will have an accompanying metadata file detailing data structure, variable definitions, and data processing steps. 

(These metadata files are obtainable when downloading data through the [NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/paleoclimatology/tree-ring) tree ring archive.)

## 5. Data Preservation and Long-Term Access
Upon project completion, the dataset will be deposited in a recognized tree ring database or repository, ensuring long-term preservation and discoverability ([NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/paleoclimatology/tree-ring)). The repository will assign a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for reliable referencing.

## 6. Data Sharing and Access
After a brief embargo period to allow for primary analysis, the dataset will be openly accessible through the repository under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license, promoting data reuse with proper attribution.

## 7. Data Ethics and Legal Compliance
Ethics approval has been obtained for the study. All data collection follows ethical guidelines, and any potential impact on tree populations or ecosystems will be minimized.

## 8. Roles and Responsibilities
The lead dendrochronologist will oversee data management, ensuring accuracy and quality. Field technicians will collect core samples and measurements. The institution's data management team will facilitate repository submission.

## 9. Budget and Resources
Funding has been allocated for specialized dendrochronology equipment, data storage, repository fees, and data management software.

This Data Management Plan ensures responsible collection, storage, and sharing of tree ring data, in adherence to dendrochronological best practices and ethical standards. It promotes the transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility of tree ring research.
